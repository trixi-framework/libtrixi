**Libtrixi** is an interface library for using Trixi.jl from C/C++/Fortran.

**Note: This project is in a very early stage and subject to changes without warning at any time.**

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Currently, libtrixi is only developed and tested for Linux.
Furthermore, a local installation of `MPI`, `p4est`, and `Julia` is required.

### Get the sources

```bash
git clone git@github.com:trixi-framework/libtrixi.git
```

### Building

For building, `cmake` and its typical workflow is used.

1. It is recommended to created an out-of-source build directory, e.g.

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. Call cmake

    ```bash
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_directory> ..
    ```

    `cmake` should find `MPI` and `Julia` automatically. If not, the directories
    can be specified manually.
    The `cmake` clients `ccmake` or `cmake-gui` could be useful.

    Specifying the directory `install_directory` for later installation is optional.

3. Call make

    ```bash
    make
    ```

    This will build and place `libtrixi.so` in the current directory along with its
    header and a Fortran `mod` file. Your application will have to include and link
    against these.

    Examples can be found in the `examples` subdirectory.

4. Install (optional)

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

    This will install all provided file to the specified location.

### Setting up Julia
After the library has been installed, you need to configure Julia for use with libtrixi. For
this, create a directory where all necessary files will be placed, e.g., `libtrixi-julia`.
Then, you can use the [`utils/libtrixi-init-julia`](utils/libtrixi-init-julia) tool to do
the rest for you:
```shell
# Assuming you are in still in the `build/` directory inside the repo clone
cd ..
mkdir libtrixi-julia
cd libtrixi-julia
../utils/libtrixi-init-julia ..
```
When running a program that uses libtrixi, make sure the set up the `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`
environment variable to point to the `julia-depot` subfolder in the
`libtrixi-julia` directory. In your code, pass the path to the `libtrixi-julia` directory as
the `project_directory` argument to `trixi_initialize`.

### Testing

Go to the repository root directory and run a simple demonstrator,
```shell
cd ..
JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=$PWD/libtrixi-julia/julia-depot \
    build/examples/simple_trixi_controller_c \
    $PWD/libtrixi-julia \
    LibTrixi.jl/examples/libelixir_demo.jl
```
which should give you an output similar to this:
```
  Activating project at `~/hackathon/libtrixi/libtrixi-julia`
Status `/mnt/ssd/home/mschlott/hackathon/libtrixi/libtrixi-julia/Project.toml`
  [7e097bd5] LibTrixi v0.1.0 `../LibTrixi.jl`
  [3da0fdf6] MPIPreferences v0.1.8

Final time reached

libtrixi: finalize
```

If you change the executable name from `simple_trixi_controller_c` to
`simple_trixi_controller_f`, you will get a near identical output. The corresponding source
files `simple_trixi_controller.c` and `simple_trixi_controller.f90` give you an idea on how
to use the C and Fortran APIs of libtrixi, and can be found in the
[`examples/`](examples/) folder.
